# Novel Neural Network weight Initialization method using Monte Carlo Method

This project compares several weight initialization methods on a deep learning model. With ResNet-50 model, we will perform CIFAR-10 classification task and compare the model accuracy for each ResNet-50 model using each weight initialization method.

### ResNet-50 default initialization
### Zero initialization
### Random initialization
### LeCun initialization
### Xavier initialization (Glorot initialization)
### Kaiming initialization (He initialization)
